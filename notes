# Necessary Operations

## Read-Only

### Get timestamp at a given index

Returns timestamp containing given index, as well as a file truncated to that
index or higher.


### Validate midstates

Validate that the midstates for a proof log in a given range are correct. If
range.start != 0, an internal midstate's validity is assumed.


## Read/Append-Only

### Append timestamp

Add one more timestamp to the end of the timestamp proof log.

Sub-variant: follow mode, where we do not quit and keep adding new timestamp
proofs over time.


## Read/Write

### Upgrade

Upgrade the proofs in the log, creating an entirely new log file.


### Prune

Prune the proofs in the log, creating an entirely new log file.


# Architecture

If we do this as async tasks, we can get progress bars, etc.
